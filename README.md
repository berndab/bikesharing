# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Introduction

New York City is one of the most challenging environments for biking. This is due to fact that it has the highest population density in the US, [27,709 people per square mile](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population), the [second worst traffic congestion in the US](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/6/16979696/new-york-city-traffic-congestion-second-worst), and is ranked the [least safe place to bike in the US](https://www.insider.com/most-dangerous-cities-to-ride-a-bike-in-2019-7#1-new-york-new-york-has-tens-of-thousands-of-bike-commuters-and-the-cycling-population-is-growing-despite-a-hrefhttpwwwnycgovhtmldotdownloadspdfcycling-in-the-citypdfover-1400-milesa-of-bike-lanes-and-a-a-hrefhttpswww1nycgovsitevisionzeroindexpagevision-zeroa-transportation-). Even with these challenges, the August ride data from NYC Citi Bike sharing service shows that the bike sharing service is a resounding success and is a frequent transportation choice for many New York city residents. Given this success dispite New York being one of the most challenging cities for biking in the US, demonstrates that a bike sharing service is potentially viable in any US city including Des Moines, Iowa.


However, the vast differences in the population size, geographical area, and car ownership rates between New York City and Des Moines Iowa, indicate that there are significant differences in the factors that influence the demand for and the utilization of a bike sharing service in each city. These significant differences must be analyzed closely to determine how applicable the NYC Citi Bike bike sharing utilization data is in predicting the feasibility of a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. 


## NYC Citi Bike Ride Data

[NYC Citi Bike Data Tableau story board](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) displays the bike share service's usage data for August 2019. This data indicates, by all measures, that the bike sharing service is a astonishing success. The data shows that the bike sharing service provided 2,344,244 bike rides during that month. Of those rides, Citi Bike yearly subscribers took 900,359 of them while one-time users took 443,856 of them. The high number of rides taken by year round users of the service demonstrates that there is steady high demand for the bike sharing service by city residents throughout the year . In addition, the data from the average trip duration by age shows that the ride sharing service usage is distributed over a wide age range of city residents from 20 up to 70 years of age. 

The NYC City Bike system has 807 ride stations that are almost evenly distributed over the service coverage area. This makes the service an attractive and flexible transportation choice for city residents who live in those areas. For those residents in those areas the map of bike station shows that there is usually a bike station close to the resident's currently located and a bike station close to where the resident want to go to. The trip duration data shows that the bike station distributed enables riders to to use the service to travel both short distance that take as little as four minutes to travel or long distances that take as long as of 45 minutes to travel. The ride data shows that riders use the service to travel as little as several blocks in the same borough, to travel between boroughs, or to travel from southern Manhattan to Central Park. Hourly usage data shows peaks usage at 9 AM and 6 PM. This indicates that a significant number of city residents choose the bike sharing service as their preferred mode of transportation for the work commute. This demonstrates how the much the bike sharing service has become an integral part of the transportation infrastructure pf the city that residents depend on for essential travel.

Overall, the bike sharing usage data shows that a bike sharing service can become an integral part of the transportation systems for any city, even one like New York, with its high traffic congestion and its streets that difficult to navigate by bike. The fact that such a significant demand for a bike sharing service exists in a city as complex and as large as New York demonstrates that cities the size of Des Moines may currently have an unmet demand for a bike sharing and that Des Moines may be an attractive place to start a bike sharing service.


## Differences Between New York vrs Des Moines

### NYC Car Ownership Rates vrs Des Moines

The [NYC % Car Ownership Tableau story board](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) show that New York City and particularly the parts of New York City in the NYC Citi Bike service coverage area have very low rates of car ownership. The car ownership rates in these area range from 18% to 60%. Overall, New York City has the [lowest rate of car ownership in the US](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html). In contrast, Des Moines has a [car ownership rate of 91.5%.](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html). This difference in car ownership rates between New York and Des Moines implies that New York residents already use some type of public transportation as a primary source of transportation and would view a bike sharing service as another viable public transportation option. In contrast, residents of Des Moines where cars are the only viable type of transportation have no history of using any public transportation and thus would be less inclined use bike sharing public transportation option with sufficient frequency to make the service viable.

### NYC Ride Frequency Map vrs Car % Ownership Map

The [Ride Frequency Map vrs Car % Ownership Map Tableau story board](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) shows a strong negative correlation between low rates of car ownership and high demand for a bike share service. This conclusively shows that lower car ownership rates significantly increases the demand for the bike sharing service in NYC. 

### NYC vrs Des Moines Population Statistics

The [NYC vrs Des Moines Population Statistics Tableau story board](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) shows a vast difference in the population makeup of New York and Des Moines. The area served by the NYC Citi Bike service has a total of 6,588,582 residents which is 30 times the population of Des Moines with its is 217,891 residents. The population density of the areas of New York that are served by the NYC Citi Bike service are 21,000 (Queens), 36,732 (Brooklyn), and 70,826 (Manhattan) residents per square mile which is 8, 15, and 29 time greater than the population density of Des Moines which is 2,471 resident per square mile. As with NYC car ownership rates, there is a high positive correlation between the population density of the areas where the bike station is located and the frequency of use of the bike shares service where use increases as the population density increases.

## Conclusion

Because of the significant differences between New York and Des Moines in terms of population and car ownership rates and the strong effect that low car ownership rates, and higher population density have on the demand for bike sharing service, the bike share data from NYC is severely limited in its ability to predict the feasibility and demand for a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. What the data does allow to be predicted is that demand for bike share service in Des Moines will be higher in areas of the city with lower car ownership rates and higher population densities. However, the data cannot predict if there will be enough demand for a bike sharing service Des Moines to make the service sustainable in the long term.

The bike sharing service in New York is a viable alternative for many resident mainly due to the fact that the areas of the city served by the Citi Bike sharing service have both low car ownership rates and high population densities which make the bike sharing service an attractive transportation option . Because of Des Moines high car ownership rates and low population density, exactly the opposite of New York, the New Your bike sharing model cannot be applied to Des Moines. 

Since the NYC data does show in general that a bike share services can become successful and an integral part of a city's transportation infrastructure, the next step should be to research bike sharing services models from cities that have a comparable size to Des Moines and also have the same and population characteristics and car ownership rates as Des Moines. A list of cities of all sizes that have bike sharing services can be found here.
