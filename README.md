# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Introduction

New York City is one of the most challenging environments for biking. This is due to fact that it has the highest population density in the US, [27,709 people per square mile](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population), the [second worst traffic congestion in the US](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/6/16979696/new-york-city-traffic-congestion-second-worst), and is ranked the [least safe place to bike in the US](https://www.insider.com/most-dangerous-cities-to-ride-a-bike-in-2019-7#1-new-york-new-york-has-tens-of-thousands-of-bike-commuters-and-the-cycling-population-is-growing-despite-a-hrefhttpwwwnycgovhtmldotdownloadspdfcycling-in-the-citypdfover-1400-milesa-of-bike-lanes-and-a-a-hrefhttpswww1nycgovsitevisionzeroindexpagevision-zeroa-transportation-). Even with these challenges, the August ride data from NYC Citi Bike sharing service shows that the bike sharing service is a resounding success and is a frequent transportation choice for many New York city residents. Given this success dispite New York being one of the most challenging cities for biking in the US, demonstrates that a bike sharing service is potentially viable in any US city including Des Moines, Iowa.


However, the vast differences in the population size, geographical area, and car ownership rates between New York City and Des Moines Iowa, indicate that there are significant differences in the factors that influence the demand for and the utilization of a bike sharing service in each city. These significant differences must be analyzed closely to determine how applicable the NYC Citi Bike bike sharing utilization data is in predicting the feasibility of a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. 


## NYC Citi Bike Ride Data

[NYC Citi Bike Data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) story board displays the bike share service's usage data for August 2019. This data indicates, by all measures, that the bike sharing service is a astonishing success. The data shows that the bike sharing service provided 2,344,244 bike rides during that month. Of those rides, Citi Bike yearly subscribers took 900,359 of them while one-time users took 443,856 of them. The high number of rides taken by year round users of the service demonstrates that there is steady high demand for the bike sharing service by city residents throughout the year . In addition, the data from the average trip duration by age shows that the ride sharing service usage is distributed over a wide age range of city residents from 20 up to 70 years of age. 

The NYC City Bike system has 807 ride stations that are almost evenly distributed over the service coverage area. This makes the service an attractive and flexible transportation choice for city residents who live in those areas. For those residents in those areas the map of bike station shows that there is usually a bike station close to the resident's currently located and a bike station close to where the resident want to go to. The trip duration data shows that the bike station distributed enables riders to to use the service to travel both short distance that take as little as four minutes to travel or long distances that take as long as of 45 minutes to travel. The ride data shows that riders use the service to travel as little as several blocks in the same borough, to travel between boroughs, or to travel from southern Manhattan to Central Park. Hourly usage data shows peaks usage at 9 AM and 6 PM. This indicates that a significant number of city residents choose the bike sharing service as their preferred mode of transportation for the work commute. This demonstrates how the much the bike sharing service has become an integral part of the transportation infrastructure pf the city that residents depend on for essential travel.

Overall, the bike sharing usage data shows that a bike sharing service can become an integral part of the transportation systems for any city, even one like New York, with its high traffic congestion and its streets that difficult to navigate by bike. The fact that such a significant demand for a bike sharing service exists in a city as complex and as large as New York demonstrates that cities the size of Des Moines may currently have an unmet demand for a bike sharing and that Des Moines may be an attractive place to start a bike sharing service.


## Differences Between New York vrs Des Moines

### NYC Car Ownership Rates vrs Des Moines

the [NYC % Car Ownership](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) story board show that New York City and particularly the part of New York City that the NYC Citi Bike service covers have very low rates of car ownership ranging from 18% to 60%. In fact, New York City has the [lowest rate of car ownership in the US](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html). In contrast, Des Moines has a [car ownership rate of 91.5%.](https://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html)

### NYC Ride Frequency Map vrs Car % Ownership Map

The [Ride Frequency Map vrs Car % Ownership Map](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) story board shows a strong negative correlation low rates of car ownership and high demand for the bike share service. This conclusively shows that car ownership rates significantly increases the demand for the bike sharing service in NYC. 

### NYC vrs Des Moines Population Statistics

The [NYC vrs Des Moines Population Statistics]() story board shows a vast difference in the population makeup of New York and Des Moines. The area served by the NYC Citi Bike service has a total of 6,588,582 which is 30 times the population of Des Moines which is 217,891. The population density of the areas of New York that are served by the NYC Citi Bike service are 21,000 (Queens), 36,732 (Brooklyn), and 70,826 (Manhattan) per square mile which is 8, 15, and 29 time greater than the population density of Des Moines which is 2,471. In addition, comparing the population desities of these areas of New York to the demand for bike sharing service show that higher population density increased the demand for bike sharing service. 

## Conclusion

Because of the significant differences between New York and Des Moines in terms of population and and car ownership rates and the correstion established be low car ownership rates, higher population density to increase usage of bike sharing service, the bike share data from NYC is severly limited in its ability to predict the feasability and demand for a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. What the data does allow to be predicted is that demand for bike share service in Des Moines will be higher in areas of the city with lower car ownership rates and higher population densities. However the NYC data cannot predict if there is a strong enough demand in Des Monines to sustain any significant demand for bike share service in any area of the city to make the service sustainable in the long term. The bike sharing service in New York is a viable alternative for many resident mainly due to the fact that large areas of the city have low car ownership rates. Because of Des Moines high car ownership rates and low population density, NYC bike sharing data has extremelhy limited usefullnes for assesing the viability of a bike share service in Des Moines other than showing that a bike shares service can be successful in general. 

Since the NYC data does show bike share services can become successful and an integral part of a city's transporation infrastructure, the next step should be to research the demand for bike sharing services from cities that have similar population characteristics and car ownership rates as Des Moines.
