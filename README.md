# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Introduction

New York City is one of the most challenging environments for biking, This is due to fact that it has the highest population density in the US, [27,709 people per square mile](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population), the [second worst traffic congestion US](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/6/16979696/new-york-city-traffic-congestion-second-worst), and is ranked the [least safe place to bike](https://www.insider.com/most-dangerous-cities-to-ride-a-bike-in-2019-7#1-new-york-new-york-has-tens-of-thousands-of-bike-commuters-and-the-cycling-population-is-growing-despite-a-hrefhttpwwwnycgovhtmldotdownloadspdfcycling-in-the-citypdfover-1400-milesa-of-bike-lanes-and-a-a-hrefhttpswww1nycgovsitevisionzeroindexpagevision-zeroa-transportation-) in the US. Even with these challenges, the August ride data from NYC Citi Bike sharing service shows that the NYC Citi Bike bike sharing service is a resounding success as a frequent transportation choice for many New York city residents even in one of the most challenging cities for biking in the US. Its success as a attractive transportation choice in such a challenging environment demonstrates that a bike sharing service has the potential to be a success in any city event one of the size of Des Moines, Iowa.


However, the vast differences in the population size, geographical area, and car ownership rates between New York City and Des Moines Iowa, indicate that there are significant differences in the factors that influence the demand for and the utilization of a bike sharing service in each city. These significant differences in these factors must be analyzed closely to determine how effective the NYC Citi Bike bike sharing utilization data is in predicting the feasibility of a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. 


## NYC Citi Bike Data - Analysis


[NYC Citi Bike Data](https://public.tableau.com/profile/dean.bernocchi#!/vizhome/bikesharing_module/NYCCitiBikeData?publish=yes) story board displays the bike share service's usage data for August 2019. This data indicates, by all measures, that the bike sharing service is a astonishing success. The data shows that the bike sharing service provided 2,344,244 bike rides during that month. Of those rides, Citi Bike yearly subscribers took 900,359 of them while one-time users took 443,856 of them. The high number of rides taken by yearly subscribers who choose use the service throughout the year indicates a high sustained demand for the bike sharing service by city residents throughout the year. In addition, the data from the average trip duration by age show that the service demand is distributed over a wide age range of city residents from 20 to 70 years of age. 

The NYC City Bike system has 807 ride stations that are almost evenly distributed over the area that the service is available. This makes the service an attractive and flexible transportation choice for city residents. For users who are located in the are the area the service covers, there is a bike station close to where they are currently located and a bike station close to where they want to go. The trip duration data shows that having bike stations both in in close proximity to where the user wants to start a trip and having stations evenly distributed for most distance ranges from the start station, allows users to choose the service to travel distance that take as little as four minutes or as long as  of 45 minutes to travel. The geographic distribution of the bike station locations allows user to use the service to travel as little as several blocks in the same borough, to travel between boroughs, or to travel from southern Manhattan to Central Park. Time of day usage data shows two usage peaks at 9 AM and 6 PM. This indicates that a significant number of city residents choose the bike sharing service as their preferred work commute transportation option. This demonstrates how the bike sharing service has become a integral part of the city's transportation infrastructure that residents depend on for essential travel.

Overall, the bike sharing usage data shows that a bike sharing service can become an integral part of the transportation option for any city, even one like New York, with its high traffic congestion and many miles of streets that difficult to navigate by bike. The fact that such a significant demand for a bike sharing service exists in a city as complex and as large as New York demonstrates that cities the size of Des Moines may currently have an unmet demand for a bike sharing and would be an attractive place to start a bike sharing service.
