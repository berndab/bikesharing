# NYC Citi Bike Analysis

## Introduction

New York City is one of the most challenging environments for biking, This is due to fact that it has the highest population density in the US, [27,709 people per square mile](https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/new-york-city-ny-population), the [second worst traffic congestion US](https://ny.curbed.com/2018/2/6/16979696/new-york-city-traffic-congestion-second-worst), and is ranked the [least safe place to bike](https://www.insider.com/most-dangerous-cities-to-ride-a-bike-in-2019-7#1-new-york-new-york-has-tens-of-thousands-of-bike-commuters-and-the-cycling-population-is-growing-despite-a-hrefhttpwwwnycgovhtmldotdownloadspdfcycling-in-the-citypdfover-1400-milesa-of-bike-lanes-and-a-a-hrefhttpswww1nycgovsitevisionzeroindexpagevision-zeroa-transportation-) in the US. Even with these challenges, the August ride data from NYC Citi Bike sharing service shows that the NYC Citi Bike bike sharing service is a resounding success as a frequent transportation choice for many New York city residents even in one of the most challenging cities for biking in the US. Its success as a attractive transportation choice in such a challenging environment demonstrates that a bike sharing service has the potential to be a success in any city event one of the size of Des Moines, Iowa.


However, the vast differences in the population size, geographical area, and car ownership rates between New York City and Des Moines Iowa, indicate that there are significant differences in the factors that influence the demand for and the utilization of a bike sharing service in each city. These significant differences in these factors must be analyzed closely to determine how effective the NYC Citi Bike bike sharing utilization data is in predicting the feasibility of a bike sharing service in Des Moines, Iowa. 


## NYC Citi Bike August Ride Data

By all measures, NYC's Citi Bike sharing service is a astonishing success.  According to the August 2019 ride data, the bike sharing service provided 2,344,244 bike rides during that month. Citi Bike yearly subscribers took 900,359 of those riders while 443,856 rides were provided to one-time users. The high number of rides taken by yearly subscribers who choose use the service throughout the year and the age data provided by the average ride time by age indicates a high sustained demand for the bike sharing service by city residents over a wide age range.

The 807 ride stations are almost evenly distributed over the area that the service is available. This makes the service an attractive and flexible transportation choice. Wherever the user is in the bike sharing service area there is a bike station close to where they are currently located and a bike station close to where they want to go. The trip duration data shows that having stations in close proximity to where the user wants to start a trip and end the trip, allows user to choose the service to travel distance that take as short a time as four minutes or to choose the service to travel distances that take as long as 45 minutes. The trip duration data show that users my use the service to go to a location in the same borough or to travel between boroughs such as going from Brooklyn to Midtown Manhattan.
The service time of day usage data shows two peaks usage times for the service that occur around 9 AM and 6 PM. This indicates that a significant number of city residents choose to commute to work by bike as their preferred transportation option. This demonstrates how the bike sharing service has become a critical part of the transportation infrastructure that city residents depend on for essential travel.

Overall, the magnitude of bike sharing usage data by city residents show that a bike sharing service can become an integral part of the transportation infrastructure of any city even one like New York with its high traffic congestion and many miles of streets that difficult to navigate by bike. The fact that such a significant demand for a bike sharing service exists in a city as complex and as large as New York demonstrates that cities the size of Des Moines may currently have an unmet demand for a bike sharing service and would be an attractive place to start a ride sharing service

There are signifcant differences between New York and Des Moines in terms of population and and car ownership which significantly affect the effectivness of the New York bike sharing data in determining the feasability of starting a bike share service in Des Moines. The population density of the three bourough of New York where bike share stations are located is between 8 and 29 time greater that the population density of Des Moines. In addition New York City ranks last in the US for car ownership with a car ownership rates in the areas of new your with bike sharing service ranging from as low as 18% to as high as 60% while Des Moines has a a car ownerhsip rate of 92%.

Since the highest use of the bike sharing serice in New York strongly correlates with the areas of the city that have the highest population desities and lowest low car ownership rates, these two condition must be considered as major factors that cause such a high demand for the bike sharing service.   

Care availabilty and car useage is areas of Manhattan are a rare occasion making residents much more receptive to using a bike sharing service while car usage in Des Moines is a daily part of all the city residients daily routine making it much harder and more out of the ordinary for residnets to be attracted to a bike sharing service
